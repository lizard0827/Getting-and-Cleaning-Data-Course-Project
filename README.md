# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#Instruction
1. Download the data set from "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip".
2. Unzip the data set into working directory.
3. Load RStudio and set your working directory using setwd.
4. Load the R script using source("run_analysis.R").
5. Run the R script, then it will generate a tidy_data.txt in your working directory.

#Dependencies
run_analysis.R file will help you to install the dependencies automatically.
